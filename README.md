# <font size=6>**Speech Enhancement for Theatre Stages Using Linear Microphone Array:**</font>

----------------



## <font size=5>**Specification**</font>

This project aims to capture audio using a linear microphone array and process it using a FPGA finally output the processed audio. The linear array consists of four microphones that are being connected to hardware using AD converters, then processed by an FPGA and output through a DA converter.

There is two different implementations of audio combination labeled as a simple and a complex algorithm.

The simple algorithm uses power estimation to determine the best source microphone. The complex algorithm calculates the position of an actor to compensate for attenuation.

## <font size=5>**Block Diagram and System Introduction**</font>

![Block_Diagram](https://github.com/Daniel3E/Speech-Enhancement-for-Theatre-Stages-Using-Linear-Microphone-Array/blob/main/Diagram/DAT096-Block_Diagram.png)

(Fig.1 Block Diagram)

The system consists of FPGA, peripheral ADC + DAC. Four microphones as Left1/2-Right1/2 channels sample analog audio and ADC will convert data to digital. **I<sup>2</sup>S receiver** operates at a sample rate of 48Khz and a BCLK-FSYNC ratio of 256, splitting the audio into four 16-bit word length. We prepare two **algorithms** for panning channels according to acoustic source distance off each microphone. A virtual distribution figure shows the correct position estimation out of ***timing-delay*** or ***power estimation***, respectively in two algorithms.  Align with enhancement and filter, the algorithm part enhances the acoustic performance. DAC, the end of the *data path*, can output the processed audio stream. 

To customize the peripheral ADC parameters, such as the I<sup>2</sup>S protocol and differential input, it is necessary to configure the relative registers in the ADC using *control path*. The **I<sup>2</sup>C master** provides valid control information writing mechanisms to ADC, and the **ADC-Configuration-Flow-Controller (_ACFC_) ** manages the priority, location, and implicit value of the register writes based on the datasheet and datapath requirements. MCLK is generated from **PLL module** as the source clock for ADC.

\* _ADC is PCM6240_Q1, DAC is DC2459C, FPGA is Nexys 100T._

## <font size=5>**ADC Wire connection to FPGA** </font>
![Block_Diagram](https://github.com/Daniel3E/Speech-Enhancement-for-Theatre-Stages-Using-Linear-Microphone-Array/blob/main/Diagram/ADC_connection.jpeg)
(Fig. The connection of the ADC)

We can see that only J11, 12, 13, 14 and J27 are installed for the input signals of the ADC. The rest  are uninstalled. MCLK is connected to the left pin of GPIO1, because we have the ADC as master. You should also resolder a zero ohm resistor on the back, to allow the ADC to run in master mode. Remove R21 and replace it to R22. 

## <font size=5>**Installation and Setup** </font>
To run the project by your own, you need to establish the communication with ADC. You need to use the switches in order. The switches on the FPGA (From 1 to 7):


{ SW_vdd_ok } —— Starts ACFC.  Set to logical 1.

{ SHDNZ_ready }  ——  Inverse shutdown of ADC. Set to logical 1. 

{ GPIO_MCLK }  —— configure GPIO1 as MCLK input.  Toggle switch to 1 then back to 0. 

{ master_mode }  —— configure device as bus master. Sets ADC to bus master. Toggle switch to 1 then back to 0. 

{ FS_48k_256_BCLK }  —— FS: 48K, BCLK: 12.288MHz. This sets the relationship between BCLK and FSYNC . Toggle switch to 1 then back to 0. 

{ I2S_mode }  —— sets protocol to I2S. Toggle switch to 1 then back to 0. 

{ finish_config_input }  —— Finish the configuration. Toggle switch to 1 then back to 0. 

{ MCLK_root }  —— Set to logical 1.

After doing the last step, you should start getting audio data from the SDOUT pin of the ADC. This is mapped through the audio capturing protocol on the FPGA.

For exact connection between the ADC and FPGA, check the constraint file.

To start the algorithm, you need to set the switch number 14 to logical 1. This sets the ENABLE_ALGORITHM flag. Then set switch 15 to 1 to enable reading of the I2S bus. If you want to send data through ethernet, set switch 16 to one. To reset ethernet driver for a new sample collection, toggle switch 8 to 1 and back to 0.

## <font size=5>**Algorithms Design (Extraction + Addressing + Combination)** </font>


As the core of the system, we designed and tested the algorithms structure consisting of multiple entities.

The simple algorithm should pan the output audio towards the loudest microphone. The blocks are described in the figure below.
![Block_Diagram](https://github.com/Daniel3E/Speech-Enhancement-for-Theatre-Stages-Using-Linear-Microphone-Array/blob/main/Diagram/Simple.PNG)

The key thought is that the complex algorithms should **extract** acoustic information from audio in each channel and **combine** them into "_join force_". It is possible to **calculate** the 2D position profile according to this _force_.

- The _cross-correlation_ extracts the signal similarity between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 channels.
- Calculation resources are rarely such that we pre-store all possible 2D positions in ROM, rather than real-time calculation. In other words, we replace calculation with **addressing** operations by sacrificing the performance (refresh rate = 0.5 ms) in an acceptable range.
- The _Picture Creator_ is a control unit to **address** the ROM.
- The _ADD_ and _MAX_ ***combine*** the output from _Picture Creator_.

##  <font size=5>**Communication between MATLAB and FPGA**</font>

The 100 MHz high-speed **Ethernet** port supported by Nexys 100T, facilitates the efficient transmission of 64-bit audio streams in Lab environment to a PC to polish up our algorithm design. An Ethernet frame comprises headers, data, and Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). The headers are parsed by the PC receiver to extract information such as MAC and IP addresses, as well as the transmission protocol. The ***User Datagram Protocol (UDP)*** provides a concise and reliable transmission mechanism for real-time audio data, making it the preferred option over ***Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)***. Additionally, the received data and the checksum can be verified using the CRC.

MATLAB provides a toolbox to receive streams through UDP, also, like what we used, there is a free but powerful tool '**_Wireshark_**'  monitoring all traffic visible on PC interface. Time stamps and source/destination will help us to analyze data.

### <font size=4>FSM in ACFC, I<sup>2</sup>C, and Ethernet</font>

FSM design is used widely in the control unit and interfaces. A **_half-fixed_ **big FSM in ACFC decides WHERE and WHAT we need to write to registers in ADC to configure it (so common in any chip configuration way). We fixed the order of key-configuration states like ***START***, ***RELEASE_ SOFT_SHUTDOWN***, ***ENABLE_CHANNEL,*** etc... apart from which, like decides FSYNC, BCLK, MASTER_MODE, AUDIO_FORMAT, is in ***unfixed code region***. That means we hew a stall state (region) up to wait for configuration by out-of-order switches.

```vhdl
--The Brain
case state is
  when idle_state =>  
	....         
  when woke_state =>              
	....  
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  - unfixed code region
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  when config_and_programm_state =>  
    if flag_finish_config_progr = '1' then
      next_state <= powerdown_state;
    else
      next_state <= config_and_programm_state;
    end if;
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  when powerdown_state  =>   
   	....
  when  config_channel_1_state =>   
  	.
  	.
  	.
  	.
  when stop_state =>
    next_state <=  waiting_state;
  when waiting_state =>
    next_state <=  waiting_state;

```

Each of the states in this ***FSM*** will call a small ‘***fsm***’ which implements I<sup>2</sup>C (master) protocol with fixed timing and format,   to write value into ADC. The relation between ***FSM*** and ***fsm*** is analog to Brain and Hand - the brain makes decisions and controls the Hand to write.
<br>



<div align=center><img src="https://github.com/Daniel3E/Speech-Enhancement-for-Theatre-Stages-Using-Linear-Microphone-Array/blob/main/Diagram/ACFC_and_I2C_fsm.png"    height = "500" /></div>

(Fig.3 FSM-fsm)

<br>

So we provide the '_start_',  '_config\_addr_', and '_config\_value_' input ports as Brain's commands for I<sup>2</sup>C. And the '_done_' output port will tell ACFC when I<sup>2</sup>C writing process is over. 

```vhdl
--The hand
entity I2C_Interface is
  port (
    clk  : in std_logic;
    rstn : in std_logic;
    -- signals between i2c and ACFC
    start : in std_logic;
    done : out std_logic;
    config_addr : in  std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    config_value : in  std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    -- i2c communication
    SDA : inout std_logic;
    SCL : out std_logic
    );
end entity I2C_Interface;
```

<br>

SCL provides the clock reference for I<sup>2</sup>C communication from a master. SDA falls when SCL = '1' represents a _launch_ then SCL will pulse at a fixed frequency to transmit data through SDA in every 8 bits PLUS 1 bit, to receive acknowledge. In other words, we set 9 states to send 8 bits and the last state is ACK state. 

Registers' addresses and values are 8 bits that 2×9 states in two launch-set can configure one register in PCM6240_Q1. Before this two-launch, however, we also need one more launch-set to appoint to the I<sup>2</sup>C slave address (fixed in datasheet) in case there are any other slaves sharing common bus (see in Fig.3).

<br>

### <font size=4>Serial-to-Parallel in I<sup>2</sup>S</font>

Serial stream mixtures 4 channels audio in SDOUT. Simple counter or fsm design can parallel channels in one FSYNC cycle since the channels' wordlength and BCLK is same one. NOTE: The audio captured is in  two's complement, with the MSB as first bit.

```vhdl
--The hand
ENTITY I2S IS
  PORT  (
    bclk:IN STD_LOGIC ;
    start:IN STD_LOGIC ;
    reset:IN STD_LOGIC ;
    fsync:IN STD_LOGIC ;
    DIN : IN STD_LOGIC;
    L1_out : out std_logic_vector (15 downto 0); --mic 1
    L2_out : out std_logic_vector (15 downto 0);
    R1_out : out std_logic_vector (15 downto 0);
    R2_out : out std_logic_vector (15 downto 0)  --mic 4
    );
END ENTITY I2S;

if (start = '1') and (reset /= '0') then
          if fsync='0' then
            go to left_channel_1_state;
          when left_channel_1_state
            count to 16 then left_channel_2_state
          when left_channel_2_state
            wait for fsync = '1' then count to 16 then 	
            right_channel_1_state
          when right_channel_1_state
           count to 16 then wait for fsync='0'
          when fsync = '0' 
           release all register values to the algorithm       
```
<br>

### <font size=4> IP core design in PLL, ROM and BRAM</font>

Xilinx provides IP core to assistant design.  

We use the clocking_wizard IP to generate an exact 12.288MHz clock that is used to synchronize the captured data by I2S. In the IP GUI, we only use in1, reset_n and out1. This means that the reset should be active low. The input clock is 100MHz and the desired output should be set to 12.28MHz.

 LUTv is a ROM to give the algorithm a fixed picture of the stage. It is look-up-table with vectors for each pixel in each correlation line. 12 bits of position data (6 bit X and 6 bit for Y), 95 (128 stored) points per line, 140 lines or 17920in total). It's generated using block memory generator IP. Set as single port ROM. width: 12 bits, length 17920. Load LUTv.coe as inital value. Always enabled.


PictureFrame block: Picture frame to store image from each cross-correlation.  32 bit depth of grayscale value, 64 by 128 pixels. It's also generated using block memory generator IP.  Set as simple dual port RAM. Read first. width: 32, length 8192. common clock. Always enabled.

## <font size=5>**TOP.vhdl workflow** (_Final version_)</font>



- ACFC decides how to configure ADC (using FSM)

- ACFC transmits value into I<sup>2</sup>C and launches I<sup>2</sup>C to push value into ADC

- PLL generates MCLK to ADC, such that ADC can generate BCLK and FSYNC from it.

- I<sup>2</sup>S receiver collects DATA from ADC and sends the four channels -- ***left1 left2 right1 right2***-- to the algorithm. Note: The signal is in two's complement.

- Ethernet supports 100M high speed for real-time audio data transmission every FSYNC.

- When both the datapath and Ethernet are enabled, audio data can be transmitted from the FPGA port to the PC port for further analysis.

- Simple-Algorithm takes the inputs and enhances the audio with one output. That is based on power estimation

- Complex-Algorithm takes the inputs, puts them through low-pass filter, then does cross-correlation and prints the correlation lines on a LUT.  One output is combined from the four attenuation compensation blocks.

- DAC takes the audio signal in two's complement, inverts it to unsigned, then outputs the audio processed by the algorithm.

## <font size=5>**Test Environment**</font>
There are input files, these files can be used for behavioral verification. To verify the output, you could save the output in LOG files, then plot the result in MATLAB and verify the behavior.

The system has been tested in and verifyed to work. The microphones used were Shure SM57 and AKG C568EB. They were placed on stands 1 m apart. We used Behringer ultragain pro mic2200 preamplifer in between the ADC and the microphone. The preamplifer is important as we do not use the gain internally in the ADC and so external gain is crucial for correct input level. For the output we had a Orange micro dark amplifier. The output amplifier is not important but was mainly used as a female to female connector adapter.
